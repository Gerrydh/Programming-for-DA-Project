    "For this project I intend to research some of the socio-economic issues that affect gun violence in the United States. Having previously lived in Chicago- a city with one of the worst gun violence rates in the country, this issue is something I have a keen interest in. I will look at some of these social and economic statistics with the aim of identifying if there is a correlation between these factors and gun related homicides."
