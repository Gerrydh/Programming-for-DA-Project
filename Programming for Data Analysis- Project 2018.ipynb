    "\n",
    "According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) there have been 51,632 incidents involving firearms, resulting in 13,247 deaths so far this year. This is an increase of 17% in deaths on 2017. There have been 608 deaths of children and 323 mass shootings, 266 police officers have been shot or killed and the police have shot or killed 1,939 suspects, and astonishingly (as it is the reason most Americans give in support of their precious Second Amendment) 1,606 or only 3% of all gun related incidents reported this year where for self-defence [3]. \n",

    "## The Second Amendment\n",
    "\n",
    "Long before the invention of weapons such as the readily accessible semi-automatic rifle or guns that can dispense one thousand rounds per minute, the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution was ratified in **December 1791** and reads: \" A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\" [4]. This declaration has become something of a badge and shield for gun activists. Shortly after the government passed a law requiring every man eligible for his local militia to obtain a gun and register with authorities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following on from the civil war the second amendment rights were debated by Congress, which abolished militias in the former Confederate states and passed the 1866 Civil Rights Act, explicitly protecting freed slaves right to bear arms. 100 years later the Black Panthers took up guns to press for equal civil rights. In reaction to this conservative lawmakers promptly took up the cause of gun control [5]. Plagued by rising levels of violent crime, the District of Columbia enacted one of the country's toughest gun control laws in the case of *District of Columbia v. Heller*. The law effectively banned handguns, automatic firearms and high-capacity weapons [6], as a result DC now has one of the lowest rates of gun violence in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "America without questions lags behind societal change as most other developed nations have set out to curb the ownership of firearms. In the UK after the Dunblane mass shooting, a public enquiry was held into the tragedy, which resulted in 28 recommendations to tighten gun control legislation, many of them where around improving the licensing system. The .22 calibre was banned, and a gun amnesty was declared, and owners compensated for their weapons- over 162,000 handguns were surrendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a mass shooting in which 35 people were killed in Australia, an amnesty resulted in 57,000 guns handed over to authorities. Lengthy background and identification check were introduced, and automatic and semi-automatic weapons banned [8].\n",

    "The National Rifle Association was founded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to 'promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis' [9]. The NRA has a budget of about \\\\$250 million each year and spent about \\$3 million of that budget lobbying lawmakers in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the NRA comes in part from their role as a major player in campaign finance. In the 2016 elections, the NRA spent over \\\\$54 million, according to data compiled by the Centre for Responsive Politics, this made them the ninth largest contributor during those elections [10]. This money was well spent; they contributed \\\\$14.4 million dollars to 44 candidates who won, and \\\\$34.4 million opposing 19 candidates who all lost [11].  But the main reason for its power are its 5 million members, most of whom are passionate about guns and their Second Amendment rights, and take that advocacy to the voting booth. The vast majority of Americans support gun control, but Congress has failed to impose tough restrictions on gun ownership. The ability of the NRA to mobilise its members is impressive, in particular to candidates who favour the Second Amendment. For instance, they operate a grading system, where an A grade is awarded to candidates who strongly support gun ownership, and lower grades for those who do not support this. The NRA then mails voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favoured candidates [12].\n",

    "In terms of race and ethnicity, 77% of white gun deaths in America are suicides, while less than 19% are homicides, and the figures are practically the opposite for African Americans, for which only 14% are suicides [15]. In his paper, Robert Nash, suggests a theory of absolute depravation, which in and of itself can lead to violence. Perhaps violence is one of the only options available to those without the economic means to deal with problems and crises of everyday life, to put it simply, absolute deprivation approach suggests that violence can occur because life is hard. In Washington DC, it is reported that every 10 fewer incidents of gunfire in a census tract are significantly related to [17]:\n",

The state with the lowest percentage of its residents living below the poverty level is 9.2 with the state with the most residents below this level is almost 22 with the average percentage working out at just under 15 percent and a standard deviation of 3.1. Our data agrees that if you live in a state that has high poverty rates you are more at risk of being involved in a homicide by firearm. The state with the highest level of poverty is well above the average deaths of 19.9 per 100,000 residents, the average being 13.2. In fact the top 14 states who report the highest level of poverty are above the average of deaths per 100,000. There are 2 outliers to this distribution, one state in particular has the highest rate of deaths per 100,000 but its poverty levels are 25 percent below the national average.\n"

    "In the US as well as other well as other countries around the world, there is a strong correlation between both poverty and income inequality. A World Bank study found that inequality helped to predict the difference in murder rates between states, economic distress was a driving factor in suicides which makes up the majority of gun related deaths in America [13].  In their report, the World Bank, looked at the relationship between inequality and crime, and observed with a degree of consistency which it noted was unusual in social sciences that lower-class people, and people living in lower-class areas, have higher official crime rates than other groups. The theory of \"relative deprivation\" states that inequality breeds social tensions as the less well-off feel dispossessed when compared with wealthier people. The distribution of security services across communities (we will look further at this factor later) also plays a part, as in many states the distribution of police services favours rich neighbourhoods [14]. \n",

To put that into context for our analysis, a coefficient of 0 would indicate that every person in the states earns the same income, and a coefficient of 1 would mean that one person earns all of the money and everybody else earns nothing.\n",

    "The next factor I used was to look at was percentage of residents who owned firearms by state. It is easy to assume that if you lived in state where a high proportion of the population owned a gun you more likely to be a victim of a gun related crime than if you lived in a state where the number of residents possessing a firearm was small, but is that the case? Statistics from the FBI indicate that a large percentage of crime in America involve handguns. In 2008 67 percent of all homicides involved a firearm. According to Krug, Powell and Dahlberg (1998) it was noted that the United States had a much higher rate of firearms being used during a homicide compared to other countries [18]. A study carried out by the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, who investigated the link between gun ownership and gun violence revealed that individuals who were in possession of a gun were 17.04 times more likely to be shot in an assault that those not in possession of a firearm, and 15 times more likely to be fatally shot [19]. The report also finds no evidence to support the perception that possessing a gun protects those who have the firearm from being shot in an assault, although successful defensive gun uses do occur, the findings of the study do not support the view that such cases are likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence of the data reveals that if you live in a state with high gun ownership, there is an increased chance that you will be involved in a fatal firearm incident. The two states with the highest gun ownership, also report the highest gun deaths per 100,000 residents. This factor also has the largest spread of values, with the smallest percentage a low 5.2, compared to the highest state standing at a whopping 61.7 percent of households possessing a firearm, the average is almost 33 percent with a standard deviation of 13.44. \n",

I looked at the percentage of residents holding a bachelorâ€™s degree to see if there was any link between low levels of education and high firearm deaths. Buzzfeed report that college education correlate strongly with gun violence levels. Even in cities with strong gun laws, the correlation holds, in Chicago for example the average rate of gun deaths in its five poorest neighbourhoods was over 12 times the rate of its least poverty-stricken areas. It is not surprising to learn that in Washington that firearm murders hardly ever happen it its wealthy neighbourhoods [20]. The graph below highlights the impact that having a more educated population can have on decreasing the number of gun related deaths can have.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared to other industrialised countries, it is clear that America has a very high firearm homicide rate, and it is also apparent that there are many factors at play in relation to this problem. A deeper dive into the issue would surely reveal that there are certain cities within states where firearm violence is more prevalent than others, which is why Washington and DC were treated separately for this review as the differences were too great to ignore. What is clear from the data collected that you are more at risk of being involved in a gun related incident than if you live in another state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top five states on the mainland who report the most gun related deaths per 100,000 are above the national average for each of the factors we used to measure the issue, with the exception of education- each of the states were below the average. This would certainly suggest that this is primarily a poverty related problem. It is also worth nothing that most of these states had above average police officers per 10,000 residents, so throwing more police at it will not necessarily make the problem go away.\n",
    "\n",
    "If politicians are too afraid to take on the NRA and make efforts to reduce the number of deadly weapons on the streets in an attempt to reduce this problem, then the data would suggest that tackling poverty levels, drug crime and increasing residentâ€™s standard of living would have a significant impact on this deadly problem.\n"
