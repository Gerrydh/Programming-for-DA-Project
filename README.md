# Programming-for-DA-Project

This repository contains, primarily a Jupyter Notebook with an investigation into America's relationship with guns, and in particular firearm homicides. I will review each states rate per 100,000 residents. I will look into if there is any relationship between states with the highest rate and factors including, the poverty rates, the qualification obtained (degree) levels, the gun ownership, population and the police officers per 10,000 residents. I will then synthesise some data based on the distributions of the data that I have obtained through the research. 

To run the Notebook, you must have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. You can install this using the [Anacona](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python Distribution. You can also view the Notebook in a static format using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

The notebook itself is called `Box Plots- An Investigation.ipynb`.
